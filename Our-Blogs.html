    	<h3>How To Tame Feral Cats And Kittens&#63;</h3>
    	<p>Waiting for the cat to reach out to you, then providing a positive interaction, will show it you can be trusted.

        Keep her coming back for more.
        The next step is to provide relaxed, non-threatening enrichment to ensure that the cat enjoys spending time with you and keeps coming back. Pet rescuers say the best time to initiate an interaction is during meal times. They also recommend providing treats and toys to encourage the cat to connect with you one-on-one.

        Slowly desensitize her to life with humans.
        Remember that many of the things we take for granted as typical aspects of life may be quite frightening to a semi-feral cat. Sounds like human voices, music, and opening and closing doors may send a nervous kitty running for the hills. Use feeding times as an opportunity to speak softly and perform slow, deliberate tasks in order to desensitize the cat and show it you are not a threat.

        Respect her space.
        Once you have welcomed your new semi-feral kitty into your home, there is still work to be done. The cat will be understandably nervous and require a place to hide when overwhelmed. This will help prevent her from feeling cornered.</p>

      <p>Some believe a feral cat cannot be tamed. Depending on a number of factors, including the cat's age, personality, and experiences in the wild, socialization is possible. It will take much time and patience. The older the cat, the more difficult it will be. Some cats may never become comfortable with human interaction, even after several months. Other cats may bond only with the human who socialized them, making them unsuitable for adoption elsewhere. There is a much greater chance of success taming a stray that has reverted to feral behavior than a cat that never had human contact, especially if its past interactions with humans were positive.</p><br>

    	<h3>What is Feral Cats&#63;</h3>
    	<p>A feral cat is one that grew up in the wild with no human contact or only negative contact. In contrast, a stray cat is a previously domesticated cat that was lost or abandoned. While strays may approach humans for food, exhibit behaviors like purring and meowing, and even allow themselves to be touched and petted, feral cats are scared of humans and view them as any other large animalâ€”a potential predator. Feral cats tend to live in colonies in abandoned buildings, junked cars, or other sheltered areas near a food source, like a restaurant dumpster. With threats of starvation, disease, bad weather, and attacks by other animals, the lifespan of a feral cat is less than two years on average.</p>

      <p>Feral cats are the result of a domestic cat being abandoned or lost and left to fend for itself. The offspring of the domestic (now considered feral) cat are usually never handled by people and become terrified. Many times, when approached by people, they will hiss out of fright. Given the chance, they will run away and hide. This is misunderstood as being vicious, but that is not true. Almost all feral cats that are trapped will cower to the back of the trap and shake from fright. Some even urinate due to uncontrolled fright. If the trap were to be opened they likely would not attack, but rather, run away.</p>
