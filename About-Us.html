          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>Pet Rescue is a small organization in Olongapo that helps pet owners keep their animals safe. When a dog or cat goes missing, Pet Rescue helps distribute information to the community and organizes a search committee to help find the lost animals and return them safely to their owners. Pet Rescue wants to develop a web application that will provide pet owners with a tool to help them find lost pets..</p>

          <p>When pet owners lose their pets, they typically post flyers around the neighborhood, ask neighbors and friends in the local community and notify Pet Rescue. Pet Rescue wants to provide them with a better and easier way to reach out to their local community for help. We also have the opportunity to create a caring and supportive community for lost pets—not only to help find them, but to console the upset pet owners. The application should look and feel simple, but friendly and sympathetic. </p>
